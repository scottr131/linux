# Which version of cgroups should we mount, version 1 or version 2?
# Please note that the rc.cgred init script (as well as the cgrulesengd
# utility itself) will not function with cgroups version 2. Upstream
# did not implement support for this since systemd handles it (of course).
CGROUPS_VERSION=2
